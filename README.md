# Analyst's Workspace


I have forgotten most of the way that this works. I'll update as I figure out what is needed.


## Configuration

There are a collection of directories that AW expects:
- build (this should be produced by the build process)
- dist (also produced by the build process)
- logs (this is required when AW runs, and it probably will not build it itself)
